<p>Responsive Banner Slider is a small but powerful slider module for Joomla. <br/ >This module is able to display image slides with amazing jquery effect by using Joomla default component banner as the image resource, so it won't need additional component to make it works.
<br />There are four animation effects used in this module, <a href="http://nivo.dev7studios.com/">Nivo</a>, <a href="http://www.philparsons.co.uk/demos/box-slider/">Adaptor</a>, <a href="http://www.sequencejs.com/">Sequence</a> and <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2011/09/05/slicebox-3d-image-slider">Slicebox</a>. Each effects can be choosen or configured easily through the module backend.</p>
<p>Note : If you choose Nivo and Sequence effect in the backend, please make sure you have filled the 'alt text' field when creating banners, because Responsive Banner Slider will use it as caption / subtitle value on the animation.</p>
